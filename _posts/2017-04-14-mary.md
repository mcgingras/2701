Today Mary Flanagan visited our class. I was a bit skeptical that I would be interested in her talk, since I am not the biggest gamer, but I really enjoyed her discussion. I think it is really interesting the way she blends political statements in her work. From what I saw, she works less for the games themselves, and more for the way they can be used to make a movement. I thought her bombscotch project was interesting in the way it provoked thought in a provocative manner. She seems to work on projects for the sake of working on them - independent of judgement or concern for how others may view her work. I respect that a lot.

I was also impressed with the amount of interesting topics Mary talked about. We discussed the ethics of educational games and what it means for a game to be educational. We also talked about the ethics of addiction in games, and in social media, and the fact that teenage depression is at an all time high. Is there a link? I am not sure, but I think it could make for a good research based art project. I am thankful Mary was able to join us for class and look forward to any speakers in the future.
