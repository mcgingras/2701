Today Will Pappenheimer video chatted our class to give a demo on AR. He is a leading figure in Augmented Reality, and it was neat to have such an important figure in the field talk to us. I will skip talking about the demo we did, because we just went through the blippar demo and there isn't much to write about (it was very useful, just a bit dry to write about.) Instead I will talk about a few of Will's pieces. My favorite of his is the sky writing piece. He created an AR piece in which people were invited to draw cloud drawings in the sky that would appear through an AR lens when the camera was pointed in the right part of the sky. I liked this piece because it was political, and gave people a platform to share messages. Not only that, but it is a really creative and fun project. It is the perfect blend of entertaining and provocative that I believe is important in interactive media.

Another project of Wills that I found interesting was his button project. This project made use of custom buttons as blips. When you scanned a person wearing the button, an AR experience would surround them. Wills project seemed more visual, but I think buttons as AR, or some other sort of wearable AR could be important in the future. It would allow us to present an additional layer onto ourselves, be it political, entertaining... etc
