### This is a class response to constructivism.

In class we had to do a bit of research on a particular style of art. Today I
was assigned constructivism, which was a Russian art movement with avent garde
vibes. Basically constructivist artists were attempting to create art that had
purpose in the sense that it propelled future ideas in architecture and design.
The goal of constructivist art was to inspire the next generation of building, and
all of their art was focused entirely on function over form.

I was a fan of this style of art. I like the idea of designing with meaning in
mind. I am trying to understand the 'depth' behind a lot of avent garde dada art
but sometimes it is hard for me. Ready-mades to me are not art - you are buying
something someone else created and putting your own name on it. I am all for
sticking it to the 'man' in the sense that a lot of high art can feel
pretentious and its refreshing to have a movement that transcends what people
typically deem good. But it still needs to accomplish something - which I think
Constructivist art does. For this reason I am appreciative of this art movement.
