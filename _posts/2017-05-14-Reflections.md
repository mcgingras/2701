#### Reflections on ART 3704

To be honest this was one of my favorite classes at Cornell. Going into the class I did not know what to expect; as a CS major, the art world was completely foreign and I was expecting to feel like a fish out of water. However I felt at home. During the course I learned of many engineers turned artists who like myself, come from a technical background but appreciate and are intrigued by art. I researched artists and explored osbornes checklist... This class pushed me outside of what I was used to, and I loved it entirely. I am inspired to continue working in the art world in any way I can. Like I said before, this course is one I will remember long after Cornell.
