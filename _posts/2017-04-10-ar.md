Coming from a technical background, I think AR and VR are incredible. Part of what makes it so fascinating to me is the fact that is allows you to expose this hidden layer of an object. I like the idea of taking an object and giving it a new lens through VR. For that reason, I decided to do my project on music. I think there is a lot of hidden meaning in music, so to me it is an interesting application of AR to have somebody scan an icon related to an artist, and be presented with visuals showing them a bit more about the meaning. I have implemented a blip of the logo of a favorite musician of mine. When it is scanned, it displays a video of his newest work, allowing a little insight into his life as a musician.

I have been thinking that I might want to do AR for my final project. I have a box of small little things that my girlfriend has given me over the years. To me, they mean a lot, but that is because of their sentimental value. To others they are meaningless items - a bottlecap, a wristband... I think it would be interesting to explore this personal space in an exhibit where people can walk around and scan these seemingly mundane items to revel their deeper personal story. Just an idea for now.
