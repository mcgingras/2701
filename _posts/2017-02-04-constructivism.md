This week we were assigned a reading about the history of digital art. I will start by saying that I am a big fan of digital art as a medium. Digital art, especially interactive media and art involving tech, is something that fascinates me and inspires my own work. The biggest draw for me is how easy it is to begin exploring. Unlike painting or drawing or other "classic" art types, digital art requires not much more than a computer and some inspiration. You do not need to study the fundamentals of form or other classic art things in order to produce great work - you just have to do it. Another reason I like digital art is because of how creative it can be. Whenever I see an interactive art exhibit it is often beyond my expectation.

The article did bring about good questions as to how saturated the market for digital art can become. If everyone can easily produce and distribute digital art, does that detract from the worth of digital art as a whole? I would argue that it does not. Digital art's accessability os one of the reasons I like it so much. If anything, the saturated nature of the digital art market makes it exciting because there are so many different styles and the sub-genres of digital art are always evolving from the network that it was born in.
