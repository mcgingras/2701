We are working with Lillypads in class today. The process of even trying to get a small light to blink was incredibly frustrating. It is difficult to work with, and since I come from a CS background and not an ECE background it is even more difficult. I can only imagine how the non technical people feel. Part of my frustration also stems from my lack of interest in the lillypad. For some reason it is not inspiring me to work on any particular project. It does not call to me in the same way other topics in this class have. From the brief amount of research that I have done, most of the projects seemed to be about aesthetics and interactive clothing. That is not something I am passionate about. I am glad we were exposed to the technology because I believe it is important to give everything a chance, but this was not something I see myself doing much more.
