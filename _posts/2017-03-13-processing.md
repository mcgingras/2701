We have been experimenting with processing in class, and I have really enjoyed the outcome. Coming from a CS background it feels natural, and there seems to be endless possibilities as to what you can create. I also like how easy it is to create a project. As we learned, it is a 'prototyping' language, which means it is intended to quickly demo and test ideas before diving deeper into the idea. I have been able to come up with interesting ideas in only a few 100 lines of code, and often times working on one project inspires the next. I think that is the true beauty behind processing - you can go into a session intending to create one idea and actually create something completely different and amazing.
