To be honest, I was not a big fan of the interview on Les Immateriaux. In my opinion, Lyotard was almost trying too hard to make push the philosophical nature of his art. I felt as though his writing was superfluous and there were times while reading the interview that I had to go back and reread a section many times to understand what he was trying to say. Maybe it is because I am adapted to reading about art related topics, but I my opinion it was more of Lyotard coming across as a condescending artist who feels the need to writing in large terms to seem like 'an academic.'

One quote I did appreciate was when he was asked about the layout of his exhibit. Lyotard said "We didnâ€™t want still another re-evocation of a gallery or a salon, by which I mean an arrangement of rooms in a Royal Palace as designed by the king." To me, Lyotard is saying that from this exhibit he did not want to be seen as the "king" who is doing everything in his own self interest and opinion of 'aesthetics'. For this exhibit he was trying to find a medium that could be appreciated by the mass audience, going against the "kingly" status quo.

All in all, I think I am going to need some time to appreciate the more "artistic" side of digital art.
