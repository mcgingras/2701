what art have you curated, what are you curating for the final project.... where would it go, how would it go, who would see it? How does your final project fit into the article?

This is a response to the white cube article we read. We have been asked to talk about our own work in respect to the white cube article. We are asked to write about what we have curated, and what we are working on for the final. I would say that my 'curation' mostly reaches music. Almost all of my work this semester has been in the music realm. For some reason I always gravitate to that as a medium. There is something attractive about music...maybe how much diversity there is in genres and the fact that everyone is in some way tied to it. My final project also has musical inspiration, and involves using low pass filters to provide a deep house feel. In regards to the location of my final project, I like to think it would work best in a large public setting where a lot of people would walk past in like an ad. For more on that you will have to wait and read my piece on my final project....
