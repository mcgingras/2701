### Ideas for Final Project

###### Kinect
For this project I would like to take a data cloud of points from a person dancing in front of a kinect, then run some visualizations on the point cloud to do something interesting.

###### AR
I have written about this before, but I would like to do something about showing the personal side of mundane objects using AR.

###### Processing
I would like to do some sort of music visualization in processing.
